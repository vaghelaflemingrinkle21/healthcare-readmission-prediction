Hospital Readmission Risk Prediction

👀 Overview
Predicts which diabetes patients are likely to be readmitted within 30 days using machine learning, enabling proactive care coordination.

🔑 Key Results
- Best Model: XGBoost (ROC AUC: 0.68)
- Top Predictors: Lab procedures, diagnosis codes, hospital stay duration
- Business Impact: $500K-$1M annual savings if 10% of readmissions prevented

🏃‍♀️🔧 How to Run
1. Upload `diabetic_data.csv` to Colab
2. Run notebook cells 1-15 in order
3. Models automatically save to `/models/`

📈 Methodology
- Data Cleaning: Handled 40%+ missing values intelligently
- Imbalance Handling: Applied SMOTE for 11% minority class
- Feature Engineering: One-hot encoding, diagnosis label encoding
- Model Comparison: Logistic Regression, RF, XGBoost, LightGBM
- Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning + threshold optimization

🚶‍♀️ Next Steps
- Deploy as API (Flask/FastAPI)
- Build Streamlit dashboard for clinical teams
- Monitor model drift on production data
